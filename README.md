# TriviaGamePseudoCode
I need to make a timer that counts down using Jquery
the timer also needs to be displayed onto screen
using HTML I must display the questions currently I have three questions displayed with radio buttons and classes for correct and incorrct answers, these will be expanded to about 10-15 questions and will also have more options per questions. (
using radio button functions i need to get a for loop to count the right, wrong and unanswered questions.
the for loop counting the answers must read which answer was selected then check the class of the selection if the class is correct then correctCount++ and if answer is wrong wrongcount++ (not sure how to get this part working yet)
I also need to insert the counter and display it on screen and make sure that when it ends It also runs the for loop that counts and sorts the selected answers
CSS needs to be written as well, although i will be using bootstrap for most of it currently i set a cyan background color but id like to clean it up
the "Done" button also needs to run the for loop incase the quiz is finished before the timer runs out. currently it is not counting the correct and wrong answers accurately

images must be uploaded and the javascript linked
